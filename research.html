    <h2>Constraining Dark Matter Annihilation in dSphs</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisor: Prof. Louis Strigari  &nbsp;| Texas A&M University
    </p>
    <p>
        I've recently started a new project under Prof. Strigari, where I will be using the updated 16 years of Fermi-LAT data to do a combined analysis of dSphs. I will also use J-factors calculated for velocity-dependent annihilation to analyze the velocity-dependent annihilation in these dSphs.

    <h2>Constraining the Mass of the Local Group in Warm Dark Matter</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisor: Prof. Nassim Bozorgnia  &nbsp;| EXPLORE
    </p>
    <p>
        From Fall 2024 - Spring 2025, I was a participant in the 5th iteration of the EXPeriental Learning Opportunity through Research and Exchange (EXPLORE) Program.

<section class="project">
    <h2>Constraining Dark Matter Annihilation in the LMC</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisor: Prof. Louis Strigari &nbsp;| Texas A&M University
    </p>
    <p>
        I analyzed gamma-ray emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud using
        Fermi-LAT data to place constraints on dark matter annihilation cross
        sections. This involved spatial modeling, J-factor construction, and
        spectral fitting.

    <h2>Asymmetric Offner Spectrograph</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisors: Prof. Darren DePoy, Prof. Jennifer Marshall, Dr. Luke Schmidt &nbsp;| Texas A&M University
    </p>
    <p>
        I designed and constructed a spectrograph which utilizes an asymmetric Offner relay. This is also the subject of my undergraduate thesis.
