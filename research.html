    <h2>Constraining Dark Matter Annihilation in dSphs</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisor: Prof. Louis Strigari  &nbsp;| Texas A&M University
    </p>
    <p>
        I've recently started a new project under Prof. Strigari, where I will be using the updated 16 years of Fermi-LAT data to do a combined analysis of dSphs. I will also use J-factors calculated for velocity-dependent annihilation to analyze the velocity-dependent annihilation in these dSphs.

    <h2>NOT Observations of XZ Cyg and DE Lac</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisor: Prof.  Camilla Juul Hansen  &nbsp;| CHINOS
    </p>
    <p>
         In July of 2025, I attended the 2nd iteration of the ChETEC-INFRA Observational School, held in Prague. The school was held at Villa Lanna in Prague and organized by Dr. Brankica Kubátová. There, I listened to lectures about nuclear physics, observational astrophysics, and science in general.
        We also went on a guided tour of the Ondřejov Observatory, and an “astronomical tour” of Prague. During the school, we had the opportunity to perform remote observing using the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). We split up into teams, and my team was headed by Prof. Camilla Juul Hansen. 
        Our goal was to observe two RR Lyrae stars, XZ Cyg and DE Lac. We were able to get 4 observations of XZ Cyg and 3 observations of DE Lac at different points in their period.
        After observing these stars, we worked on analyzing their spectra using WebSME, looking for the radial velocity, temperature, and other properties and abundances of the stars. 
        After the observational school was over, we continued working together as a team, and Dr. Zdenek Prudil joined our team and provided us with software, which we are currently using to continue our analysis of the stars.

    <h2>Constraining the Mass of the Local Group in Warm Dark Matter</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisor: Prof. Nassim Bozorgnia  &nbsp;| EXPLORE
    </p>
    <p>
          From Fall 2024 - Spring 2025, I was a participant in the 5th iteration of the EXPeriental Learning Opportunity through Research and Exchange (EXPLORE) Program. 
        I was on the “Local Group of galaxies with warm dark matter” team. Our goal was to find the mass of the local group by using the timing argument on MW and M31 analogues in the COCO Warm simulation set, which we did successfully.

    <h2>Constraining Dark Matter Annihilation in the LMC</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisor: Prof. Louis Strigari &nbsp;| Texas A&M University
    </p>
    <p>
        I analyzed gamma-ray emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud using
        Fermi-LAT data to place constraints on dark matter annihilation cross-sections for both velocity-dependent and velocity-independent annihilation. 
        I used J-factor maps that my collaborator, Evan Vienneau, calculated from the Aurgia simulations, to better model the dark matter component of the LMC for the S-wave, P-wave, D-wave, and Sommerfeld annihilation models.
        I also analyzed Ursa Major II and Segue I, and applied enhancement factors calculated by my collaborator, Odelia Hartl, to improve the bounds on the P-wave and D-wave annihilation cross sections of dark matter.

    <h2>Asymmetric Offner Spectrograph</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisors: Prof. Darren DePoy, Prof. Jennifer Marshall, Dr. Luke Schmidt &nbsp;| Texas A&M University
    </p>
    <p>
        I started my project in the Munnerlyn Instrumentation Lab in May 2023. My goal was to design and build a spectrograph that uses a type of mirror relay known as an asymmetric Offner relay.
        A secondary goal was to use only commercially available optics in the spectrograph and to utilize 3D printing to construct custom mechanical parts. I first selected suitable parts to create the Offner relay from Thorlabs and Edmund Optics, then I created the optical design in Zemax OpticStudio. 
        After that, I imported my optical design into SolidWorks and designed the enclosing structure as well as positioned the mirror and grating mounts. 
        I also designed the connection between the telescope and the instrument (which also houses a guide camera), which was almost fully 3D printed, with an adjustable-width slit inserted, and the threads of the connection machined out of aluminum.
        I then had the front, where the connection and camera thread into the instrument, and the base plate, where I mounted the mirrors and grating machined out of aluminum. 
        Finally, I assembled the instrument. This was the subject of my undergraduate thesis. Currently, two undergraduates in the instrumentation lab have joined the project and are working on printing the enclosure and developing the control software.

    <h2>UV Type 1a Supernovae</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisor: Dr. Peter Brown &nbsp;| Texas A&M University
    </p>
    <p>
        I worked with Dr. Peter Brown as part of the Aggienova group, where I focused on the UV parts of Type 1a supernovae. My first project was to learn Python and write a program to sigma clip and bin type 1a spectra to clean them up. 
        After that, I worked on a program to combine spectra from two distinct Hubble Space Telescope gratings, so that I could help reduce the noise that comes from being on the edge of an instrument's range. 
        Finally, I worked on creating synthetic photometry of type 1a SNe spectra in the UV range through different Swift satellite filters. 
        Though the spectra of two type 1a SNe may look similar, small differences in the UV range can be amplified greatly depending on the observing filter. This means that it is important to do k-correction for each individual type 1a instead of applying a general k-correction.
