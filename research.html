    <h2>Constraining Dark Matter Annihilation in dSphs</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisor: Prof. Louis Strigari  &nbsp;| Texas A&M University
    </p>
    <p>
        I've recently started a new project under Prof. Strigari, where I will be using the updated 16 years of Fermi-LAT data to do a combined analysis of dSphs. I will also use J-factors calculated for velocity-dependent annihilation to analyze the velocity-dependent annihilation in these dSphs.

    <h2>NOT Observations of XZ Cyg and DE Lac</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisor: Prof.  Camilla Juul Hansen  &nbsp;| CHINOS
    </p>
    <p>
         In July of 2025, I attended the 2nd iteration of the ChETEC-INFRA Observational School, held in Prague. The school was held at Villa Lanna in Prague and organized by Dr. Brankica Kubátová. There, I listened to lectures about nuclear physics, observational astrophysics, and science in general.
        We also went on a guided tour of the Ondřejov Observatory, and an “astronomical tour” of Prague. During the school, we had the opportunity to perform remote observing using the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). We split up into teams, and my team was headed by Prof. Camilla Juul Hansen. 
        Our goal was to observe two RR Lyrae stars, XZ Cyg and DE Lac. We were able to get 4 observations of XZ Cyg and 3 observations of DE Lac at different points in their period.
        After observing these stars, we worked on analyzing their spectra using WebSME, looking for the radial velocity, temperature, and other properties and abundances of the stars. 
        After the observational school was over, we continued working together as a team, and Dr. Zdenek Prudil joined our team and provided us with software, which we are currently using to continue our analysis of the stars.

        I was a member of the 2nd iteration of the Goethe Research Experience Program, located at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany.

    <h2>Constraining the Mass of the Local Group in Warm Dark Matter</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisor: Prof. Nassim Bozorgnia  &nbsp;| EXPLORE
    </p>
    <p>
        From Fall 2024 - Spring 2025, I was a participant in the 5th iteration of the EXPeriental Learning Opportunity through Research and Exchange (EXPLORE) Program.

<section class="project">
    <h2>Constraining Dark Matter Annihilation in the LMC</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisor: Prof. Louis Strigari &nbsp;| Texas A&M University
    </p>
    <p>
        I analyzed gamma-ray emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud using
        Fermi-LAT data to place constraints on dark matter annihilation cross
        sections. This involved spatial modeling, J-factor construction, and
        spectral fitting.

    <h2>Asymmetric Offner Spectrograph</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        Advisors: Prof. Darren DePoy, Prof. Jennifer Marshall, Dr. Luke Schmidt &nbsp;| Texas A&M University
    </p>
    <p>
        I designed and constructed a spectrograph which utilizes an asymmetric Offner relay. This is also the subject of my undergraduate thesis.
